        :data:`PROBE_VISION_RADIUS`, harvester radius
        :data:`HARVESTER_LOS_RADIUS`). The frontend renders any tile
        present here as a dimmed **echo** cell after the observer
        leaves, so surface vision from a harvester persists the same
        way probe vision does (RULEBOOK §3.11).

        Visibility tiers (RULEBOOK §3.8):

        * **fog**  — never seen / forgotten; absent from echo + memory.
        * **echo** — historical vision recorded here; cell exposes the
          last-known terrain, occupants, and entity glyph.
        * **live** — a unit currently has the cell in LOS (probe disk
          covers it, or a harvester is standing on it this frame).
          Live vision is computed each render in
          :meth:`tiles_visible_now`; this pulse is purely about the
          *echo* tier.

        Self-exclusion (v0.9.13): when any observer pulses the cell it
        occupies right now, the snapshot drops the observer itself from
        ``occupants`` / ``glyph_*`` so the echo doesn't ghost a phantom
        of the observer onto the map. For harvesters the trail overlay
        already says "this unit walked here"; for probes the live render
        shows the probe while it exists, so a destroyed probe leaves only
        the last SQUARE state behind, not a frozen ghost-probe glyph.
        Other units present at that frame still flow through normally —
        that's genuine intel the player should keep. Stale entity glyphs
        (e.g. an enemy harvester last seen here) are kept in the snapshot

        - ``paint`` — precomputed CSS-ready fg/bg/glyph for that origin.

          preset and seed — would stop matching the game the player is
