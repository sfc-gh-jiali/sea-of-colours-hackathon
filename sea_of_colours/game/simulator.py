"""Night runner — executes per-player move queues into the session state.

The orchestrator gives each player a 21-hour *applied* budget per night
(RULEBOOK §3.10 v0.7.4 — one applied move per planetary night hour).
Queues themselves may be longer (up to :data:`MAX_QUEUE_LEN`); invalid
items — whether structurally malformed (``WasteMove`` markers from the
parser) or rejected at runtime (out-of-bounds step, harvester still
orbital, etc.) — are surfaced as yellow error log lines next to the
attempted action and **do not** consume a slot from the player's
budget. The simulator advances each player's pointer past invalid items
until it finds a valid one, applies it (one valid move per round per
player, alternating p1 → p2), and pushes a replay frame.

Rules (v0.6.0):

- Each *valid* applied move consumes one of :data:`MAX_MOVES` slots.
- Each *invalid* item logs an error (``level: "error"``) and is skipped.
- Harvester drop / step harvests every coloured tile entered — RED →
  GREEN, GREEN → EMPTY, BLUE → EMPTY (RULEBOOK §3.12). There is no
  per-night cap; the natural limit is the harvester's 6-parcel hold
  (drop + 5 steps).
- Probes spawned during the queue persist across nights — they're only
  destroyed when a harvester rides over them.
- Harvesters still on the surface at dawn forfeit their cargo.

        Returns the set of harvester ids that should have their
        hour-``hour`` action smothered as ``tag="empd"`` because they
        sit inside an active EMP cloud cell. Side-effects:

        * Decays existing EMP clouds (RULEBOOK §5).
        * Peeks each seat's next-actionable move. If it's an
          ``EmpLaunchMove`` or ``ChaffFlareMove`` AND the cost check
          passes, the move is APPLIED INLINE: cost debited, pointer
          advanced, slot consumed, replay frame pushed. If the cost
          check fails, the move is left for the main dispatch (which
          will turn it into a normal runtime-waste — pointer
          advances, slot NOT consumed, the seat retries with the
          next move).
        * Chaff triggerers are tracked in
          ``chaff_triggerers_by_hour[hour]`` so the main loop's
          chaff-gate can recognise them as immune.

        EMP effects ALWAYS resolve before regular moves at the same
        hour ("emp_first" — RULEBOOK §5 / user spec). That ordering
        is enforced structurally: clouds tick + launches resolve
        before the disable check runs, so a launch at hour N is in
        effect for the same hour's disable computation.

        v1.19 — chaff outranks the salvo, and outranks itself. Two rules,
        one cause (RULEBOOK §4.9.5 — "EVERY seat's action in each covered
        hour is cancelled"):

        * A flare fired at ``hour`` cancels a **same-hour** EMP launch,
          so this method resolves flares first and only then salvos.
        * ``chaff_active_until`` is the last hour covered by a window
          opened on an EARLIER hour. Inside such an hour nothing
          pre-empts at all.

        Either way the cancelled launch burns its slot (``tag="chaffed"``,
        applied by the main dispatch) but **keeps its munition in stock**
        for a later hour or night — a jammed house never got to fire, so
        it never spent the round.

        Resolving both launch types in one seat-ordered pass is what let
        chaff be chained into a lock (each flare re-armed the window and
        re-granted its launcher immunity) and let a salvo fly out of a
        fully jammed house — whichever seat the loop happened to reach
        first simply won.

        lander therefore takes a cell its rival is lifting off without a
        collision, which is what the rulebook has always said and what
        the shipped agent has always been told (V12's SEEN_GRAB doctrine:
        "drop on it, auto-harvest, and lift").

        Decided at hour start, before any seat acts, because the bug this
        closes was that the answer depended on whether the engine's seat
        loop reached the lifter or the lander first — an implementation
        detail with no rules standing (§3.10, §3.13). See
        docs/OUTSTANDING_ISSUES.md #56.

        Deciding it up front is only sound because **every way a pickup
        can fail is a static precondition** — no such harvester, lifter
        not in orbit, harvester already orbital. None of them depend on
        what another seat does this hour, so a pickup promised now cannot
        be falsified later and leave a lander sharing a cell with a unit
        that never left. Step-aways do NOT have that property (a step can
        be refused by an EMP cloud, a snap-hot cell or its own collision),
        which is why they are not in here and are still order-dependent.
