"""Night runner — executes per-player move queues into the session state.

The orchestrator gives each player a 21-hour *applied* budget per night
(RULEBOOK §3.10 v0.7.4 — one applied move per planetary night hour).
Queues themselves may be longer (up to :data:`MAX_QUEUE_LEN`); invalid
items — whether structurally malformed (``WasteMove`` markers from the
parser) or rejected at runtime (out-of-bounds step, harvester still
orbital, etc.) — are surfaced as yellow error log lines next to the
attempted action and **do not** consume a slot from the player's
budget. The simulator advances each player's pointer past invalid items
until it finds a valid one, applies it (one valid move per round per
player, alternating p1 → p2), and pushes a replay frame.

Rules (v0.6.0):

- Each *valid* applied move consumes one of :data:`MAX_MOVES` slots.
- Each *invalid* item logs an error (``level: "error"``) and is skipped.
- Harvester drop / step harvests every coloured tile entered — RED →
  GREEN, GREEN → EMPTY, BLUE → EMPTY (RULEBOOK §3.12). There is no
  per-night cap; the natural limit is the harvester's 6-parcel hold
  (drop + 5 steps).
- Probes spawned during the queue persist across nights — they're only
  destroyed when a harvester rides over them.
- Harvesters still on the surface at dawn forfeit their cargo.

        Returns the set of harvester ids that should have their
        hour-``hour`` action smothered as ``tag="empd"`` because they
        sit inside an active EMP cloud cell. Side-effects:

        * Decays existing EMP clouds (RULEBOOK §5).
        * Peeks each seat's next-actionable move. If it's an
          ``EmpLaunchMove`` or ``ChaffFlareMove`` AND the cost check
          passes, the move is APPLIED INLINE: cost debited, pointer
          advanced, slot consumed, replay frame pushed. If the cost
          check fails, the move is left for the main dispatch (which
          will turn it into a normal runtime-waste — pointer
          advances, slot NOT consumed, the seat retries with the
          next move).
        * Chaff triggerers are tracked in
          ``chaff_triggerers_by_hour[hour]`` so the main loop's
          chaff-gate can recognise them as immune.

        EMP effects ALWAYS resolve before regular moves at the same
        hour ("emp_first" — RULEBOOK §5 / user spec). That ordering
        is enforced structurally: clouds tick + launches resolve
        before the disable check runs, so a launch at hour N is in
        effect for the same hour's disable computation.

        v1.19 — chaff outranks the salvo, and outranks itself. Two rules,
        one cause (RULEBOOK §4.9.5 — "EVERY seat's action in each covered
        hour is cancelled"):

        * A flare fired at ``hour`` cancels a **same-hour** EMP launch,
          so this method resolves flares first and only then salvos.
        * ``chaff_active_until`` is the last hour covered by a window
          opened on an EARLIER hour. Inside such an hour nothing
          pre-empts at all.

        Either way the cancelled launch burns its slot (``tag="chaffed"``,
        applied by the main dispatch) but **keeps its munition in stock**
        for a later hour or night — a jammed house never got to fire, so
        it never spent the round.

        Resolving both launch types in one seat-ordered pass is what let
        chaff be chained into a lock (each flare re-armed the window and
        re-granted its launcher immunity) and let a salvo fly out of a
        fully jammed house — whichever seat the loop happened to reach
        first simply won.

        v1.48 (RULEBOOK §3.17) — a harvester being lifted is *departing*,
        and §3.17 collides two harvesters **arriving** on one cell. A
        lander therefore takes a cell its rival is lifting off without a
        collision, which is what the rulebook has always said and what
        the shipped agent has always been told (V12's SEEN_GRAB doctrine:
        "drop on it, auto-harvest, and lift").

        Decided at hour start, before any seat acts, because the bug this
        closes was that the answer depended on whether the engine's seat
        loop reached the lifter or the lander first — an implementation
        detail with no rules standing (§3.10, §3.13). See
        docs/OUTSTANDING_ISSUES.md #56.

        Deciding it up front is only sound because **every way the move
        can fail is knowable now**. For a pickup they are all static —
        no such harvester, lifter not in orbit, harvester already
        orbital — and none of them depend on what another seat does.

        v1.49 (§3.17.7) — **step-aways are in here too**, which is what
        closes the hand-off gap. It looks like it should not be possible:
        a step CAN be refused by something a rival does, namely a
        collision at its own destination. But that is the only such
        reason, and it is the one this method computes. Reading
        ``try_step_unit`` from the top, every other refusal is static —
        wrong owner, not on the surface, already damaged, not adjacent,
        out of bounds, hold full — and the two dynamic gates above it in
        the simulator, chaff and an EMP-smothered unit, are both settled
        before the round and passed in. Everything *after* the collision
        check moves the harvester unconditionally: a snap-hot cell
        cripples it where it lands and an EMP cloud denies it the
        harvest, but neither rewinds the step, so the origin is vacated
        either way.

        So the question "will this cell be free?" becomes a fixpoint
        over the step graph rather than a race:

        - A step whose destination is empty goes.
        - A step whose destination is being vacated by a step that goes,
          goes — which resolves a convoy of any length.
        - A step blocked by someone who stays is refused, and that
          refusal propagates back down the chain behind it.
        - What survives with nobody stationary to blame is a **cycle**,
          and a cycle is allowed: everyone in it is leaving. Note the
          grid is bipartite, so the shortest cycle is four harvesters;
          the two-unit case is a pass-through swap and §3.17.4 collides
          it, which the swap pre-pass has already settled before we get
          here.
        - Two or more steps into ONE cell collide (§3.17.6) and nobody
          vacates, so they are excluded before the fixpoint runs.

        v0.9.6 — generalised to walk every (a, b) seat pair in
        :attr:`GameSession.players`. A swap is still pair-wise
        (RULEBOOK §3.6) — only two harvesters cross at a time — but
        with 3-4 seats two independent pairs can swap on the same hour.

        v1.48 — and both pairs now resolve HERE, on this hour. This
        used to stop at the first pair and lean on the outer round loop
        to catch the second one, which quietly cost the second pair an
        hour: the loop derives its clock from ``max(applied) + 1``, and
        the first pair had just bumped ``applied``. Both pairs wrecked
        either way, so the board was right and only the replay lied —
        but it lied about WHO, because the pair on the lower seats
        always got the earlier stamp, and §3.13 gives seat index no say
        in anything. (The per-seat re-stamp downstream cannot repair
        it: a joint collision frame is owned by nobody, and that pass
        skips frames with no owner.)

        hour's slot in the pre-hour phase. Their next queued move
        belongs to a LATER hour, so pairing it with a rival's move for
        *this* hour both grants a second action and stages a collision
        between two moves that were never simultaneous.

        v1.49 (§3.17.6). §3.17's governing sentence collides two harvesters
        *arriving* on the same cell, and this is the plainest possible
        case of it — but it was not one of the four illustrated
        patterns, so it fell through to the ordinary seat loop. There
        the first seat walked completed its step and **took the cell**,
        and only the second was turned back. Both wrecked either way,
        so the cost was not who survived but where: the winner's wreck
        sat on the contested cell, the scars followed it, and which
        harvester won was decided by seat index (§3.13 says it has no
        say in anything).

        Settled the way §3.17.3 and §3.17.4 settle the other two step
        patterns: nobody moves, everybody wrecks **at their original
        positions**. The scar goes on the contested cell, following
        §3.17.2 — the other case where a destination is fought over and
        no one arrives.

        Deciding it before the round is sound for the same reason the
        egress snapshot is: every remaining way ``try_step_unit``
        refuses a move is a **static precondition** — not on the
        surface, already damaged, not adjacent, out of bounds, hold
        full — so no rival can falsify one of them mid-hour and leave
        two harvesters wrecked over a step that was never going to
        happen. The two that are NOT static are excluded up front:
        chaff (the caller only runs the pre-passes on an unjammed hour)
        and an EMP-smothered unit, which is why ``disabled_units`` is
        passed in.

        A healthy harvester already standing on the contested cell is
        rammed too and wrecks in place (§3.17.3), without spending a
        slot — it is not acting, it is being run into. That case had the
        same disease one cell over: the occupant was wrecked by whichever
        stepper the seat loop reached first, and the SECOND stepper then
        strolled on unharmed, because by then the occupant was a wreck
        and wrecks do not block (§3.17.1).

        v1.49 — an occupant that is *leaving* this hour is not an
        occupant. ``departing_units`` is the egress fixpoint, so a cell
        being vacated counts as empty and the arrivals collide with each
        other over it, not with the harvester on its way out.

        Crushing is normally the mover's own business, done inside its
        slot, and for the ordinary case that is right: a harvester rides
        onto a probe that was already there. It is wrong when the probe
        launches onto the harvester's cell on the SAME hour, because
        then the answer turned on seat index. Prober first and its probe
        was flattened by the landing that followed; harvester first and
        the probe settled underneath one and lived, which is also the
        only way the board could ever show a probe and a harvester
        sharing a cell.

        This closes it without disturbing the mover's crush, which keeps
        its caption, its frame and its kill-feed credit. The sweep runs
        once every seat has acted, so by then the ordinary case has
        cleaned up after itself and the only thing left to find is a
        probe that arrived late.

        A cell with more than one harvester on it is a wreck pile, and
        the crush is credited to nobody: picking one of them would put
        the seat loop back in charge of the answer.
